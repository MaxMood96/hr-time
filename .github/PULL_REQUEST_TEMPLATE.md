Closes #???

Person merging, please make sure that commits are squashed with one of the following as a commit message prefix:

- chore: fixes unrelated to the spec itself (e.g., fix to Github action, html tidy, spec config, etc.). 
- editorial: a non-normative change to the spec (e.g., fixing an example or typo, adding a note).
- change: a normative change that significantly changes, or "breaks", existing engine behavior.
- And use none if it's a new normative requirement. 

If this is a "change", please explain what's significantly changing specially if anything is breaking?

For normative spec changes, please get implementation commitment during the review process. All tasks should be complete before merging.
